## Project Description
For our Embedded Systems Project class we decided to build a smart car based on Google's Waymo. The car has the ability to:
* Follow a Line
* Avoid Obstacles
* Take Directions for following the line
* Be remotely controlled through a PS4 Controller or Website in real time.

The car was a 10 weeks project where we learned about connecting to a database, working with motors, using multiple different sensors and, most importantly, how to build a large scale project as a team.
